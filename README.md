# Benchmarking Scripts and Datasets for GFFx

This directory contains benchmarking scripts and datasets used to evaluate the performance of **GFFx** and other GFF/GTF tools on large-scale feature extraction and region-based queries.

It is designed to generate **reproducible, large-scale performance comparisons** among tools, including:

- [`GFFx`](https://github.com/Baohua-Chen/GFFx)
- `gffutils`
- `gffread`
- `agat`
- `bedtools`
- `bcbio-gff`

## How to Use

### Step 1: Prepare GFF & FASTA index files

Make sure files like `at.gff` and `at.fa.fai` exist in the working directory.

### Step 2: Run the full benchmark

```bash
bash run_benchmark.sh
```

This will:
- Run index generation using multiple tools
- Generate 100 input files per task
- Benchmark extract & intersect using different tools per datas
- Save timing logs to structured folders

## Output Structure

After running `benchmark.sh`, results will be organized as:

```
extract/
  â””â”€â”€ at/
      â””â”€â”€ gffx/
          â”œâ”€â”€ input_001.txt
          â””â”€â”€ run_001.log
intersect/
  â””â”€â”€ dm/
      â””â”€â”€ gffutils/
          â”œâ”€â”€ input_087.txt
          â””â”€â”€ run_087.log
```

Each `run_*.log` contains `/usr/bin/time -v` output with memory and runtime metrics.
